      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-core-competencies-are-how-do-they-enable-businesses&#34;&gt;What core competencies are? How do they enable businesses?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core competencies are a collection of skill sets that help to differentiate a professional and their competitive worth to the business and thus the market. Despite much research, it is still unknown what constitutes a winning formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should be highlighted is that a company that does not have collaborators who grow around their &amp;ldquo;core competencies&amp;rdquo; is unable to compete and create. &amp;ldquo;This is a deceptively difficult task.&amp;rdquo; Prahalad says.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-scheduling-a-meeting&#34;&gt;Before Scheduling a Meeting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certain preconditions for being successful in what meetings are related. First, remote working guidelines and no meeting day are sufficient but not necessary for a good practice of meetings coordination. Yet, the two patterns mentioned above include rituals that are key to a solid foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follows essential principles that you need to have in mind before scheduling a meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Own your calendar&lt;/strong&gt; - keep your calendar accurate (even, for the non-meeting event), be conscious of the different timezones;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of us have been forced by the pandemic to work in a new reality. Even though forced work from home != remote work, I would like to reinforce some practices that are in place in workplaces with distributed teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acknowledgments:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This page would not be possible without the collaboration and discussions with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/NunoFilipeSantos&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nuno Santos&lt;/a&gt;, Silvia Bessa and Ana Rebelo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;chat&#34;&gt;Chat&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack/Microsoft Teams are currently the go-to apps for teams communications. Discord is a great tool for voice. I usually leave it open at certain times of the day for impromptu communications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
