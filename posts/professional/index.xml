      <description>&lt;p&gt;In April 2020 I have started working on a new project to revolutionize how customers shop. For that purpose, we have written a blog post introducing Farfetch Chat (previously known as iFETCH), a conversational AI technology with multimodal capabilities developed by FARFETCH in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST), and Universidade Nova de Lisboa (NOVA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farfetch Chat aimed to revolutionize the online high-fashion sector by providing a &amp;ldquo;physical store&amp;rdquo;-like experience through natural interaction using both textual and visual data. The project focused on four pillars: natural language understanding and generation, dialogue management, product catalog and multimodal knowledge base, and product retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
