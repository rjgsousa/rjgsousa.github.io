[{"categories":null,"contents":"In an era of information abundance, the ability to efficiently extract key insights from vast amounts of text has become an invaluable skill. This is particularly true for books, where complex narratives and intricate arguments can make it challenging to grasp the essence of a work. Consequently, automated book summarization techniques, which employ AI (more recently leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs)) to distill lengthy texts into concise, informative summaries, have emerged as an increasingly reliable resource.\nHowever, the question remains: How reliable are the latest LLMs in automated book summarization? To explore this, I started a small but exciting project to:\nAssess cutting-edge Llama 3.1 language model performance (renowned for its impressive capacity to process and understand large chunks of text), and; Understand how RAG capabilities could improve the summarization capabilities of such powerful models. Facing the Challenge It is widely acknowledged that creating high-quality summaries poses diverse challenges. It\u0026rsquo;s not just about maintaining the coherence (for fiction books, for instance) of the narrative, preserving the main characters, their traits, and personalities, but also providing a clear overview of the passage or book\u0026rsquo;s scope and content. This requires a deeper understanding of the material, going beyond a mere summary of the book.\nThe key objectives of this study were to investigate the following research questions:\nCan the current most robust LLM generate reliable summaries even when its context window is reduced (henceforth, the baseline method)? Would integrating the LLM with a simple RAG with its books and informative documents about summarization techniques lead to improved accuracy and better results? Methods I leveraged the Llama (3.1) 70b model, which boasts an extensive context window of 128k tokens (infrastructure provided by Groq). To streamline my experiment, I integrated the llamaindex library. Given the elevated context window of Llama 3.1, its context_window was truncated to a lower number. This allowed me not only to assess the Tree Summarize algorithm performance but also to understand the RAG capabilities enabled by my experiment did provide.\nTo enable the RAG capabilities, I used the Booksum dataset. I also included some literary analysis articles. These articles provide valuable insights and contextual information that can enhance the quality and depth of the generated book summaries.\nEarly Results Preliminary experiments using this approach have yielded interesting results. When tasked with summarizing chapters from James Fenimore Cooper\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Last of the Mohicans,\u0026rdquo; the AI-generated summaries demonstrated a reasonable ability to identify and present key plot points.\nQuantitative metrics, such as ROUGE indicated a high degree of similarity between baseline and the RAG-enabled with literacy documents. However, these metrics don\u0026rsquo;t capture the full picture. Qualitative analysis, involving a closer examination of the content and flow of the summaries, highlighted other aspects in the AI\u0026rsquo;s output. Consider the following example for the baseline:\nIn a serene forest setting, two men, Chingachgook, a Native American, and Hawkeye, a white man, engage in a conversation. They discuss their ancestors, traditions, and the history of their people. Chingachgook shares the story of how his tribe, the Mohicans, arrived in the area and fought against other tribes. Hawkeye listens intently and responds with his own perspective, highlighting the differences between their cultures. Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Uncas, Chingachgook\u0026rsquo;s son, who reports that he has been tracking a group of Maquas, a rival tribe. Hawkeye and Chingachgook decide to hunt for food, and Uncas successfully kills a deer using his bow and arrow. As they prepare to eat, they hear the sound of approaching horses and realize that a group of white men is approaching. The scene is set in a forest near a river, with a serene atmosphere, but also with an undercurrent of tension and potential danger. The conversation between Chingachgook and Hawkeye highlights the complexities of their relationship and the cultural differences between their people. The arrival of Uncas and the subsequent hunting scene showcases the skills and traditions of the Native American characters.\nNow, consider the output from the RAG-enabled approach:\nThe scene shifts to a forest where two men, a Native American named Chingachgook and a white man named Hawkeye, are conversing. Chingachgook is a member of the Mohican tribe, and Hawkeye is a hunter and scout. They discuss their respective cultures and traditions, with Chingachgook sharing the story of his people\u0026rsquo;s migration to the area and their conflicts with other tribes. Hawkeye listens intently and responds with his own perspective, acknowledging the differences between their cultures. As they talk, a young warrior named Uncas, Chingachgook\u0026rsquo;s son, appears and joins the conversation. Hawkeye and Uncas engage in a discussion about hunting and the skills required to track and kill game. Hawkeye is impressed by Uncas\u0026rsquo;s abilities and acknowledges that the Native Americans have a deeper understanding of the natural world. The conversation is interrupted by the sound of approaching horses, and Chingachgook identifies the riders as white men. Hawkeye takes charge and prepares to communicate with the newcomers, speaking in English and boasting of his ability to communicate with people of different cultures. The scene ends with the arrival of the white men, who are likely to be the main characters of the story.\nand, finally, from the human annotation:\nThe narrator shifts the focus of attention from Magua and his party to another group of people in another part of the forest, a few miles west by the river. We meet the remaining primary characters: Hawkeye, a white hunter, and Chingachgook, his Mohican ally. Though both men are hunters, they dress differently. Hawkeye wears a hunting shirt, a skin cap, and buckskin leggings; he carries a knife, a pouch, and a horn. Chingachgook is almost naked and covered in war-paint. Both men carry weapons. Hawkeye carries a long rifle, and Chingachgook carries a short rifle and a tomahawk. They discuss the historical developments that have caused them to both inhabit the same forest. Hawkeye proclaims his inheritance of a genuine and enduring whiteness, and Chingachgook laments the demise of his tribe of Mohicans. Of the Mohican tribe, only Chingachgook and his son remain. At this mention of the diminishing tribe, Chingachgook\u0026rsquo;s son Uncas appears and reports that he has been trailing the Maquas, the Iroquois enemies of the Mohicans. When the antlers of a deer appear in the distance, Hawkeye wants to shoot the animal, but then realizes that the noise of the rifle will draw the attention of the enemy. In the place of the long rifle, Uncas uses an arrow to kill the deer. Shortly thereafter, Chingachgook detects the sound of horses approaching\nLook closely to the subtle distinctions in this concise example (similar patterns can be seen in several other cases): The arrival of Uncas and the subsequent hunting scene showcases the skills and traditions of the Native American characters. with Hawkeye and Uncas engage in a discussion about hunting and the skills required to track and kill game. What\u0026rsquo;s striking is how the two summaries share similarities yet diverge in their emphasis on the sequence of events.\nWhat is ahead of us? Despite the challenges, the advancements in this field are remarkable. In regard to this project:\nThe base LLM, even with a reduced context window, yielded impressive results. The RAG approach, augmented with literary documents, enabled the model to provide more detailed and nuanced descriptions of certain passages. However, a more thorough quantitative analysis is necessary to further validate these findings and identify areas for improvement.\nSource code to be released soon.

How do they enable businesses? Core competencies are a collection of skill sets that help to differentiate a professional and their competitive worth to the business and thus the market. Despite much research, it is still unknown what constitutes a winning formula.\nWhat should be highlighted is that a company that does not have collaborators who grow around their \u0026ldquo;core competencies\u0026rdquo; is unable to compete and create. \u0026ldquo;This is a deceptively difficult task.\u0026rdquo; Prahalad says.\nFig. How competencies are strictly connected with our product development (from [1]).\nWe will be able to unravel the various portfolios of competences with which our scientists will be gifted by undertaking this exercise. It should be highlighted, however, that there is no expectation of a pre-defined set of competences, and the outcome of this exercise should not be interpreted as a recipe that must be followed. It should be regarded as a resource from which a scientist might advance into specialised areas of competence. In fact, a scientist can be defined in a variety of ways, and we provide the following examples for the purposes of this exercise:\nAn end-to-end scientist/engineer capable of developing concepts and bringing it to market;\nA theoretical/fundamental scientist who understands the abstract and fundamental notions of a given subject; and,\nAn applied scientist who employs the appropriate concepts to solve real-world problems.\nYou may have noticed that I have offered three separate roles for different domains here. Even while this structure is on purpose, we won\u0026rsquo;t get into the specifics right now. Instead, we\u0026rsquo;ll concentrate on the competencies. Take ``Data Science\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; (it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be seen as a discipline but as an umbrella-term/meta as it is composed of different) competencies such as mathematics (algebra, logic, number theory, calculus, statistics, graph theory, game theory, causality), computer science (software engineering, programming, networking, databases, data structures), artificial intelligence (machine learning, pattern recognition, computer vision, natural language processing), communication, economics/finance, and many others.\nThe issue that must be posed is, where can someone with, for example, natural language processing skills contribute the most to the product\u0026rsquo;s development?\nTeam responsibilities and setting expectations. With that said, we should mention that for the sake of their competencies the following should be ascertained:\nÂ«Decentralization (\u0026hellip;) as makes it difficult to focus on key competencies (causing individuals to become more reliant on outsiders for critical skillsÂ»;\nOn the other side, centralization may result in a lack of concentration because one team would be accountable for all types of problems, resulting in resource competition and extended delivery time. When this occurs, satellite teams often develop their own solutions, independent of the primary team.\nGiven the variety of paths that a scientist can take throughout their professional path, we will concentrate on the nuclear components of the role, ignoring any additional fields that would lead to specialisation.\nProblem At this moment, it is evident that we have three distinct angles: the business, the talents of an individual contributor, and, unavoidably, the team organization.\nAs a result, we can pose the following questions:\nHow do you design and create a product while maximising the competencies of individual contributors?\nAt the same time, how can we help to their continuous development and growth?\nHow should the teams be organised at the same time?\nAs should be evident, as the product expands (and, by extension, the teams centred on it grow in size), so does the problem, as do the diversity of technological solutions and, of course, the skills that feed its growth.\nNext steps In coming postings, I will explore some of my experience to address these hypotheses in further depth, leaving this article with the questions outlined above open for consideration.\nReferences [1] - Prahalad, C.K. and Hamel, G.

How will I know that this meeting was a success?\u0026rdquo;\nOk, so you have decided to schedule a meeting. What\u0026rsquo;s next?\nKeep your meetings short - be objective, be actionable (change your calendar settings so that all meetings default to 30minutes);\nWhat is the problem that you want to solve? - Does your meeting have an agenda?;\nKnow who needs to attend - is this a need-to-attend meeting or, welcome-if-curious? Is it both?\nPre-Read \u0026amp; Agenda - Share any information that attendees should know and/or read ahead of meeting; define an agenda/order of business before the meeting;\nTime - in a distributed team in different timezones, be clear on the time and avoid jargon such as \u0026ldquo;the first hour of the morning\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;CoP\u0026rdquo;; Avoid back and forth emails, and use an app such as https://calendly.com/ when having a meeting with externals; avoid back-to-back meetings; Another tool of choice is the clockwise.\nMeeting We are now having the meeting.

If it falls all under one single person, that one will be responsible to pay attention to the conversation and write the details of the meeting in a clear, concise and precise way! If it fails, the blame will fall onto that person. Do it collaboratively as a group-editable meeting minute.

In e-mails and chats thereâs lot that is lost in messages (e.g., expressions, cultural differences). Assume the best intentions of your peers. Fear of missing out: An increasing concern in remote teams - establish working agreements like flexible working hours [see gitlab guide]; if a decision needs to be made, set up a working plan, deadlines and meeting/brainstorm sessions - if necessary - to write it down. Give your team and colleagues time to digest the information. Practice active listening and speak slowly and calmly, give some short spaces with no talk and some silence in between each intervention (e.g., eventual lag in video call) [see tips for remote working] Team ceremonies (Daily stand-up, item refinements and retrospective meetings) - continue to do it or be more involved. Dailies are teamâs heartbeat [see tips for remote working]. Connect your camera, we are all humans (If they donât have a headset or webcam turned on, itâs a bit of a smell [see social]) Get a headset \u0026#x1f4a1; be funny, sociable. Keep your Focus and plan better (not more) - Try Pomodoro technique to have periods of work and small breaks [see tips for remote working] Define priorities and adjust accordingly Small, minor tasks, leave to the end of the week - usually on a Friday afternoon Socialise: Have social gatherings like you have in the office - Create opportunities for a cup of tea/coffee, biscuit [see social] Keep your reading/book clubs Keep your team brainstorming sessions References Pair Programming https://github.com/kkemple/awesome-pair-programming tools for pair programming [Blog] https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-makes-premium-version-of-hangouts-meet-free-as-more-people-work-remotely/355170/ [Blog] https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/helping-businesses-and-schools-stay-connected-in-response-to-coronavirus Tips Remote work [Blog] https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-simple-tips-scrum-teams-only-help-working-remote-daniel-carrilho/\nSocial [PPT] https://2019.leanagile.scot/programme/space-between-tale-remote-teams-and-distributed-working - props to my colleague @Erika Nitsch\nTools [Blog] https://www.scrumexpert.com/tools/free-retrospective-tools-for-distributed-scrum-teams/\nGuide [Blog] https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/\n","date":"October 25, 2020","hero":"/images/sections/posts/remote-work/remote-work.png","permalink":"https://rjgsousa.github.io/posts/management/ways-of-working/remote-work/introduction/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSome of us have been forced by the pandemic to work in a new reality.
