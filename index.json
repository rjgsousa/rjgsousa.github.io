How do they enable businesses? Core competencies are a collection of skill sets that help to differentiate a professional and their competitive worth to the business and thus the market. Despite much research, it is still unknown what constitutes a winning formula.\nWhat should be highlighted is that a company that does not have collaborators who grow around their \u0026ldquo;core competencies\u0026rdquo; is unable to compete and create. \u0026ldquo;This is a deceptively difficult task.\u0026rdquo; Prahalad says.\nFig. How competencies are strictly connected with our product development (from [1]).\nWe will be able to unravel the various portfolios of competences with which our scientists will be gifted by undertaking this exercise. It should be highlighted, however, that there is no expectation of a pre-defined set of competences, and the outcome of this exercise should not be interpreted as a recipe that must be followed. It should be regarded as a resource from which a scientist might advance into specialised areas of competence. In fact, a scientist can be defined in a variety of ways, and we provide the following examples for the purposes of this exercise:\nAn end-to-end scientist/engineer capable of developing concepts and bringing it to market;\nA theoretical/fundamental scientist who understands the abstract and fundamental notions of a given subject; and,\nAn applied scientist who employs the appropriate concepts to solve real-world problems.\nYou may have noticed that I have offered three separate roles for different domains here. Even while this structure is on purpose, we won\u0026rsquo;t get into the specifics right now. Instead, we\u0026rsquo;ll concentrate on the competencies. Take ``Data Science\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; (it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be seen as a discipline but as an umbrella-term/meta as it is composed of different) competencies such as mathematics (algebra, logic, number theory, calculus, statistics, graph theory, game theory, causality), computer science (software engineering, programming, networking, databases, data structures), artificial intelligence (machine learning, pattern recognition, computer vision, natural language processing), communication, economics/finance, and many others.\nThe issue that must be posed is, where can someone with, for example, natural language processing skills contribute the most to the product\u0026rsquo;s development?\nTeam responsibilities and setting expectations. With that said, we should mention that for the sake of their competencies the following should be ascertained:\n«Decentralization (\u0026hellip;) as makes it difficult to focus on key competencies (causing individuals to become more reliant on outsiders for critical skills»;\nOn the other side, centralization may result in a lack of concentration because one team would be accountable for all types of problems, resulting in resource competition and extended delivery time. When this occurs, satellite teams often develop their own solutions, independent of the primary team.\nGiven the variety of paths that a scientist can take throughout their professional path, we will concentrate on the nuclear components of the role, ignoring any additional fields that would lead to specialisation.\nProblem At this moment, it is evident that we have three distinct angles: the business, the talents of an individual contributor, and, unavoidably, the team organization.\nAs a result, we can pose the following questions:\nHow do you design and create a product while maximising the competencies of individual contributors?\nAt the same time, how can we help to their continuous development and growth?\nHow should the teams be organised at the same time?\nAs should be evident, as the product expands (and, by extension, the teams centred on it grow in size), so does the problem, as do the diversity of technological solutions and, of course, the skills that feed its growth.\nNext steps In coming postings, I will explore some of my experience to address these hypotheses in further depth, leaving this article with the questions outlined above open for consideration.\nReferences [1] - Prahalad, C.K. and Hamel, G.

Despite much research, it is still unknown what constitutes a winning formula.\nWhat should be highlighted is that a company that does not have collaborators who grow around their \u0026ldquo;core competencies\u0026rdquo; is unable to compete and create.","tags":null,"title":"Core Competencies: An Introduction"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Before Scheduling a Meeting There are certain preconditions for being successful in what meetings are related. First, remote working guidelines and no meeting day are sufficient but not necessary for a good practice of meetings coordination. Yet, the two patterns mentioned above include rituals that are key to a solid foundation.\nFollows essential principles that you need to have in mind before scheduling a meeting:\nOwn your calendar - keep your calendar accurate (even, for the non-meeting event), be conscious of the different timezones;\nPlan our week ahead of time - avoid context switching and be objective on where our time is going to be focused;\nThink on the following questions before scheduling a meeting - \u0026ldquo;Is this an FYI? How will I know that this meeting was a success?\u0026rdquo;\nOk, so you have decided to schedule a meeting. What\u0026rsquo;s next?\nKeep your meetings short - be objective, be actionable (change your calendar settings so that all meetings default to 30minutes);\nWhat is the problem that you want to solve? - Does your meeting have an agenda?;\nKnow who needs to attend - is this a need-to-attend meeting or, welcome-if-curious? Is it both?\nPre-Read \u0026amp; Agenda - Share any information that attendees should know and/or read ahead of meeting; define an agenda/order of business before the meeting;\nTime - in a distributed team in different timezones, be clear on the time and avoid jargon such as \u0026ldquo;the first hour of the morning\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;CoP\u0026rdquo;; Avoid back and forth emails, and use an app such as https://calendly.com/ when having a meeting with externals; avoid back-to-back meetings; Another tool of choice is the clockwise.\nMeeting We are now having the meeting. What should you expect?\nTime - Be there on time! Seriously! If possible, be there ahead of time;\nCoordination - Have the agenda ready. You should be flexible, though. If there aren’t items in the agenda ask the ones that are already on the meeting to add their items while others join;\nTime and Be respectful - Start after three minutes \u0026ldquo;out of respect for those who were punctual\u0026rdquo; - people that run late will add their items to the agenda by order;\nTaking Notes - Notes or meeting minute is a burden. If it falls all under one single person, that one will be responsible to pay attention to the conversation and write the details of the meeting in a clear, concise and precise way! If it fails, the blame will fall onto that person. Do it collaboratively as a group-editable meeting minute. Notes are essential for participants that couldn’t attend where they can refer to learn what was discussed and decided.\nNo meeting high-jacking! - is when someone prevents a meeting from covering scheduled topics until their (unscheduled) topics are covered first. Avoid the potential risk of creating a culture of participants attending a meeting \u0026ldquo;just in case\u0026rdquo;. If you run in any off-topics items added to the agenda, ask \u0026ldquo;is this quick and are all stakeholders here?\u0026rdquo;\nQuotes \u0026ldquo;Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value. It is not rude to leave, it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time\u0026rdquo; - Elon Musk\nReferences \u0026#x1f4d6; Distributed Teams: The Art and Practice of Working Together While Physically Apart by John O\u0026rsquo;Duinn\n","date":"November 22, 2020","hero":"/images/sections/posts/meetings/meeting.jpg","permalink":"https://rjgsousa.github.io/posts/ways-of-working/meetings/introduction/","summary":"Before Scheduling a Meeting There are certain preconditions for being successful in what meetings are related.

In e-mails and chats there’s lot that is lost in messages (e.g., expressions, cultural differences). Assume the best intentions of your peers. Fear of missing out: An increasing concern in remote teams - establish working agreements like flexible working hours [see gitlab guide]; if a decision needs to be made, set up a working plan, deadlines and meeting/brainstorm sessions - if necessary - to write it down. Give your team and colleagues time to digest the information. Practice active listening and speak slowly and calmly, give some short spaces with no talk and some silence in between each intervention (e.g., eventual lag in video call) [see tips for remote working] Team ceremonies (Daily stand-up, item refinements and retrospective meetings) - continue to do it or be more involved. Dailies are team’s heartbeat [see tips for remote working]. Connect your camera, we are all humans (If they don’t have a headset or webcam turned on, it’s a bit of a smell [see social]) Get a headset \u0026#x1f4a1; be funny, sociable. Keep your Focus and plan better (not more) - Try Pomodoro technique to have periods of work and small breaks [see tips for remote working] Define priorities and adjust accordingly Small, minor tasks, leave to the end of the week - usually on a Friday afternoon Socialise: Have social gatherings like you have in the office - Create opportunities for a cup of tea/coffee, biscuit [see social] Keep your reading/book clubs Keep your team brainstorming sessions References Pair Programming https://github.com/kkemple/awesome-pair-programming tools for pair programming [Blog] https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-makes-premium-version-of-hangouts-meet-free-as-more-people-work-remotely/355170/ [Blog] https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/helping-businesses-and-schools-stay-connected-in-response-to-coronavirus Tips Remote work [Blog] https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-simple-tips-scrum-teams-only-help-working-remote-daniel-carrilho/\nSocial [PPT] https://2019.leanagile.scot/programme/space-between-tale-remote-teams-and-distributed-working - props to my colleague @Erika Nitsch\nTools [Blog] https://www.scrumexpert.com/tools/free-retrospective-tools-for-distributed-scrum-teams/\nGuide [Blog] https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/\n","date":"October 25, 2020","hero":"/images/sections/posts/remote-work/remote-work.png","permalink":"https://rjgsousa.github.io/posts/ways-of-working/remote-work/introduction/","summary":"Some of us have been forced by the pandemic to work in a new reality.
