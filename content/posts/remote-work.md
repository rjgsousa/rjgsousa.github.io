Some of us have been forced by the pandemic to work in a new reality. Even though forced work from home != remote work, I would like to reinforce some practices that are in place in workplaces with distributed teams.

## Setup
#### Chat
Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord

Slack/Microsoft Teams are currently the go-to apps for teams communications. Discord is a great tool for voice. I usually leave it open at certain times of the day for impromptu communications. 

#### Video Conference
Google Meets, Zoom

#### Source Control
Git, duh!

## Tooling
#### Pair Programming
More tools listed in [[Pair Programming Tools](#pair-programming)]

- https://tmate.io/

#### Meetings, brainstorm sessions and other ceremonies
Also, in [[other tools](#tools)]
- WhiteBoard
- IdeaBoardz 
- Miro


## Patterns

- Over-communicate - Communicate with your team mates like you do in the office and do it more often
- Give the benefit of a doubt. In e-mails and chats there’s lot that is lost in messages (e.g., expressions, cultural differences). Assume the best intentions of your peers.
- Fear of missing out: An increasing concern in remote teams - establish working agreements like flexible working hours [[see gitlab guide](#guide)]; if a decision needs to be made, set up a working plan, deadlines and meeting/brainstorm sessions - if necessary - to write it down. Give your team and colleagues time to digest the information.
- Practice active listening and speak slowly and calmly, give some short spaces with no talk and some silence in between each intervention (e.g., eventual lag in video call) [[see tips for remote working](#tips-remote-work)]
- Team ceremonies (Daily stand-up, item refinements and retrospective meetings) - continue to do it or be more involved. Dailies are team’s heartbeat [[see tips for remote working](#tips-remote-work)]. 
  - Connect your camera, we are all humans (If they don’t have a headset or webcam turned on, it’s a bit of a smell [[see social](#social)])
  - Get a headset 
  - :bulb: be funny, sociable. 
- Keep your Focus and plan better (not more) - Try Pomodoro technique to have periods of work and small breaks [[see tips for remote working](#tips-remote-work)]
  - Define priorities and adjust accordingly
  - Small, minor tasks, leave to the end of the week - usually on a Friday afternoon 
- Socialise: Have social gatherings like you have in the office - Create opportunities for a cup of tea/coffee, biscuit [[see social](#social)]
  - Keep your reading/book clubs
  - Keep your team brainstorming sessions
