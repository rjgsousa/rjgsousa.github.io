Some of us have been forced by the pandemic to work in a new reality. Even though forced work from home != remote work, I would like to reinforce some practices that are in place in some well-known companies with distributed teams.

## Patterns
- Over-communicate - Communicate with your team mates like you do in the office and do it more often
- Give the benefit of a doubt. In e-mails and chats there’s lot that is lost in messages (e.g., expressions, cultural differences). Assume the best intentions of your peers.
- Fear of missing out: An increasing concern in remote teams - establish working agreements like flexible working hours [7]; if a decision needs to be made, set up a working plan, deadlines and meeting/brainstorm sessions - if necessary - to write it down. Give your team and colleagues time to digest the information.
- Practice active listening and speak slowly and calmly, give some short spaces with no talk and some silence in between each intervention (e.g., eventual lag in video call) [2]
- Team ceremonies (Daily stand-up, item refinements and retrospective meetings) - continue to do it or be more involved. Dailies are team’s heartbeat [2]. 
  - Connect your camera, we are all humans (If they don’t have a headset or webcam turned on, it’s a bit of a smell   [5])
  - Get a headset 
  - :bulb: be funny, sociable. 

- Keep your Focus and plan better (not more) - Try Pomodoro technique to have periods of work and small breaks [2]
  - Define priorities and adjust accordingly
  - Small, minor tasks, leave to the end of the week - usually on a Friday afternoon 

- Socialise: Have social gatherings like you have in the office - Create opportunities for a cup of tea/coffee, biscuit [5]
  - Keep your reading/book clubs
  - Keep your team brainstorming sessions
