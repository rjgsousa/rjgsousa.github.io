In April 2020 I have started working on a new project to revolutionize how customers shop. For that purpose, we have written a blog post introducing Farfetch Chat (previously known as iFETCH), a conversational AI technology with multimodal capabilities developed by FARFETCH in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST), and Universidade Nova de Lisboa (NOVA). 

Farfetch Chat aimed to revolutionize the online high-fashion sector by providing a "physical store"-like experience through natural interaction using both textual and visual data. The project focused on four pillars: natural language understanding and generation, dialogue management, product catalog and multimodal knowledge base, and product retrieval.

If you want to learn more, check out our blog post on Farfetch Chat at [medium](https://farfetchtech.medium.com/ifetch-multimodal-conversational-agents-for-the-online-fashion-marketplace-b14ca1bc094). This was the first in a series of posts that provided updates on the progress and developments of this project aimed at transforming the online luxury fashion shopping experience through advanced conversational AI technology.
